## Purpose

IBIMANUKA as an idea came from my frustration when I'm constantly struggling to find information about various Rwandan topics, especially when it comes to historical events, people, and places. I wanted to create an archive to nourish my curiosity and to help others who are interested in learning about Rwanda.
